# Telco Customer Churn Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data for a telecom company to understand the reasons why customers leave and to identify actionable insights to reduce churn. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), DAX measures, and interactive Power BI dashboards, the project delivers key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations that highlight customer behavior and churn trends.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare a reliable dataset  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships  
- Creation of key KPIs such as:  
  - Total Customers  
  - Churn Rate (%)  
  - Average Monthly Charges  
  - Average Tenure (months)  
  - Long-Term Customers (tenure > 24 months)  
- Interactive Power BI dashboard with:  
  - KPI cards for quick summary  
  - Line charts and bar charts for trend and segment analysis  
  - Slicers for dynamic filtering by demographics and contract types  
  - Tables for detailed customer segmentation  
- Use of DAX formulas to create custom measures and improve data insights  

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas): Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation  
- DAX: Custom calculations and dynamic measures
